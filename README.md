- In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution.Equivalently, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution.

  # cental theorem #
- Suppose you have a population with any shape of probability distribution (not necessarily normal), and you draw random samples of a fixed size from this population. As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.
